* **Petcube Bites 2**

#### **Review Of The Best Dog Camera Treat Dispenser:**

1. **Furbo Dog Camera and Speaker (Treat Tossing, Full HD Wifi Pet Camera)** 

This is a high-tech device along with sophisticated features to help you and beloved pets. The device is supported by a treat tossing device. You just have to fill the device with their favorite treat and control it by using the Furbo app.

The treats will pop up and let the puppy catch it. Furbo is also designed with a barking alert feature. Just like the name, the feature helps to identify the barking. The system is connected to your smartphone so you know what is going on. You may also talk to him or her via the app.

There is even a live streaming video feature so you can monitor their activity, especially when you are not at home. You may want to know how dog camera with treat dispenser work, right? It’s simple! You just need to plug the dispenser to a power outlet by using a USB cord.

Then, download the Furbo app and connect your Wi-Fi. That’s it! You are ready to use the device to keep your puppies happy and you don’t need to worry to leave them for a couple of hours.

**Pros**

* The ‘Barking Sensor’ feature offers real-time alerts and has saved the lives of over 100 dogs, from hazards such as fires, gas leaks, and intruders.
* Compatible with Amazon Alexa – simply connect via wifi/Bluetooth and enable voice commands for a hands-free dispenser.
* 5 light colors enable your dog to see whether or not the dispenser is in use since dogs are able to see yellow and blue light.
* Easy 3-step setup.
* Featured on TheEllenShow, and highly-rated by leading brands such as InStyle, Buzzfeed, and Forbes – so you know you’re getting the best treat dispenser for your buck.
* 1080p night vision function allows you to see crystal clear video at all hours.

**Cons**

* Two-Way Audio feature is somewhat misleading: this dispenser features radio-style audio, which means you have to push a button to speak. This is a downfall mainly because it means you can’t talk freely and it’s more jarring, but it also means you can’t save your audio this way.
* Some users noted difficulties with setting up – this product requires some trial and error.
* Camera feed takes some time to load each time you open the app

2. **Petcube Bites Pet Camera - _Wifi Pet Camera With Treat Dispenser_**

This device helps you to schedule the treats so your dogs don’t lose their treats although you are not at home. The special thing is that you can fill a variety of treats on the device including dry and crunchy dog treats. It is also suitable for cat lovers who want to give treats regularly.

The Petcube app allows you to control and monitor the condition of the pets only from your phone. Let say, you can talk with them by using a two-way audio system and let them barks to replay you.

Another great thing is that you can use the Cloud-based video storage where you can record a short video and save it so you can watch it anytime you want.

**Pros**

* Provides full-duplex, natural sound with a four-mic arrangement and high-quality speaker bar.
* Quick & simple two-minute setup.
* This is one of the only pet camera treat dispensers that supports 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiFi connections. This makes it completely unique in its ability to provide a faster, more reliable connection and universal compatibility with ALL modern routers.
* Adjustable treat-tossing distance between Short-, Medium- and Long-Range.
* The highest capacity for dog treats, carrying up to 1.5lbs of doggy treats.
* Made by a globally-recognized and admired pet camera brand.

**Cons**

* Requires phone or device with an operating system of iOS 11 or Android 7.1.2 or higher. Therefore, if your phone(s) or device(s) have systems older that are older, you need to update them or they will not be compatible. Devices that can’t be updated will be obsolete in terms of their compatibility with this product.
* Expensive – Not the best budget dispenser for everyone.

3. **PetChatz HDX Pet Treat Camera**

If you get confused about how to choose an interactive dog camera with a treat dispenser, you can learn from this review. PetChatz is an interactive treat dispenser so you can communicate with your beloved pets although you are not at home.

This device works more than just an ordinary dispenser in which it is supported by everything that your dog loves them. Besides a two-way video chats feature, your pet will get a treat from the dispenser.

Moreover, it helps your dog to remain calm along with calming aromatherapy so they don’t get confused and bark all day long. Even, they can even have some fun brain games. The point is that the device will not make them get bored while they are home alone.

**Pros**

* Full-Screen LCD Display streams DOGTV (for an additional subscription) so your pet is never bored.
* Only premium pet camera and treats dispenser that provides both two-way audio AND two-way video for Skype-esque video chats so your pupper is never alone.
* 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wifi compatibility.
* Has a pet-safe ‘Calming Aromatherapy’ feature to keep pets with separation anxiety calm and relaxed.
* Brain Games to train your dog or pet alert and mentally agile throughout the day.

**Cons**

* Lowest rating on Amazon, with 4.1 stars from 30 reviews.

4. **WoPet Treat Tosser Smart Pet Camera:**

**![](https://barkforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WoPet-Treat-Tosser-2-300x300.png)**

##### **WoPet Treat Tosser Smart Pet Camera**

* Fill the treat dispenser and play the catch game with your pets.
* It’s also equipped with Night Vision feature.Spy on your pets in the dark without disturbing them.
* Not only can you see what’s happening at home, but also send voice commands and scare off intruders to keep your pets safe.

The top of the camera (the black circle in the photo above) easily pops off to allow you to fill the dispenser with treats or kibble. Just keep in mind that treats need to be very small less an 1/4″ wide to fit through the opening. Kibble works great, but small training treats would also be a good choice.

I walk you through the app in my video guide above, but it's very easy to navigate – even for the most technologically challenged. Once you sign in to the app you just select your device and it will upload the live feed from the camera in your home.

There are three buttons on the app screen screen. One allows you to turn on the microphone and send a message to your pet. It will continue recording and sending messages until you turn the microphone off. Unlike other similar products, the WOpet camera doesn't just play the same prerecorded message over and over again. You can send a unique message every time.

Another button allows you to take still photos or short videos of your pet to save or share on social media. The third button looks like a little dog treat. When you press this one, the device will launch dog treats onto the floor for your pet to enjoy. Mine shoots 1-3 pieces of kibble each time.

Not only is this dog camera great for treating and talking to your pet while you're away, it gives curious dog owners a way to see what their pet is up to all day. It uses a 720p HD camera, which (as you can see in my video above) provides a clear picture.

However, most pet cameras use a 1080p HD camera. You can do a quick Google search to learn the science behind these two resolutions, but in layman's terms, the 1080p provides a better picture. I don't notice much a difference, honestly, but I feel that I should mention this difference because I know it's important to the techies of the world.

The camera is also equipped with night vision, which is a must have feature for me. I live in Maine, so it gets dark early here in the winter months. If I use a camera that doesn't have night vision, I can't check on my pets after 4:00 p.m. in the winter!

It only took about 3 minutes to set up this pet camera. All you have to do is download the app on your device and plug in the camera. The camera will connect to your home's WiFi and the app will walk you through the startup process.

**Pros**

* Turn treat-giving into a fun game for both you and your dog! – When you click the ‘Toss’ button, the dispenser will emit a fun sound while ‘tossing’ a treat out for your dog to catch. This is both enjoyable AND effective because the combination of the catchy tune and tasty treat will help establish a positive association between the treat dispenser and the treat/reward. Now, each time you go to dispense a treat, your dog will be left feeling happy, rewarded, and satisfied.
* Clear, two-way audio so you can listen and talk to your pets from any location, AND keep your family safe by scaring off intruders!
* The wide-angle lens and 4x digital zoom function allow you to see the entire room, or to focus in on a particular portion of it for detailed viewing.
* Night-vision function allows you to keep your family, pet, and your home safe 24/7.
* Sturdy, sealed cover to prevent spillages.

**Cons**

* Only very small treats will fit within this dispenser – any bigger than 0.39″ x 0.39″ and the treats will NOT dispense.
* Night Vision function is unpredictable and hazy without lights.

5. **Iseebiz Smart Pet Camera**

**Features:**

**FAQ:**

### Is this dog camera treat dispenser good for small dogs?

The Furbo is great for all sizes and breeds of dogs. The treats are limited in size so obviously you can’t give a huge amount of them to a larger sized dog. But they are only meant to be treats, not a meal.

Any sized dog benefits from hearing your voice through the Furbo. You can calm your dog down when they need it.

If your dog suffers from separation anxiety you can calm them remotely and throw a treat to really distract them. It really will make you smile being able to toss out the treat and see them happy even while you’re at work.

### Will the camera work at night?

Yes. The camera on this dog camera treat dispenser is top notch and it even works at night and in low light. With a built-in infrared camera lens it is perfect for all times of the day.

### Are there alerts?

Yes. The feature I like the most is the push notifications that are sent to you when you dog barks. If your dog is upset or injured and they bark, you’ll know about it even if you’re away from the house.

Obviously, if your pet is bored, it is fun to be able to toss them a treat to keep them busy. But if by some chance your dog is injured or sick it is so important to be able to see them on the camera and hear them barking or crying so you can go to them or phone for help.

### How does the Furbo connect to the internet?

The Furbo dog camera treat dispenser runs on your house wifi. Most people don’t have a problem connecting it but a few have needed to get a wifi extender because their wifi signal is too weak.

It depends where you want to place your Furbo. If your signal is weak you may be thinking about buying a wifi extender anyway, to use for other devices in your home. It is just something to keep in mind.

### Can I use my own treats?

Yes. The information about Furbo says that treats should be about half an inch in size. But actually to be exact the treats need to be 0.4 inches in size to work properly and shoot out of the Furbo dog camera treat dispenser.

One of the dog treats that works well with the Furbo is the Natural Balance Mini-Rewards Semi-Moist Dog Treats (Click Here to see more details).

You can actually use any treats you like so long as they are the right size and not too compressible.

### Can more than one family member log in to Furbo at once?

Yes. Two people can log in at the same time to the Furbo dog camera treat dispenser. You can only have one account with one login password but you can have two people logged in at the same time.

The only real restriction with two people on Furbo at the same time is that you can’t both shoot the treats out at the same time.

### Who would benefit from owning the Furbo dog camera treat dispenser?

If you leave your dogs at home to go to work, you’ll love the Furbo. It can be worrying leaving your dogs at home alone. The Furbo gives you peace of mind.

The Furbo is also great if you’re going away for a weekend and you know someone else is coming in to check on them and feed them. Obviously if there is no one with them for most of the time you’ll be concerned. The Furbo dog camera treat dispenser lets you see and talk with your pet while you’re away.

If your dog has an illness, injury or disability you’ll be delighted with the Furbo. It lets you monitor the safety of your dog when you’re not at home. We can’t always be at home all the time. The Furbo can let you see if your dog needs you urgently. And, as already mentioned, the text alerts when your dog barks are invaluable.

Everyone in your family will love the Furbo. Your dogs will be happier and you’ll have peace of mind knowing you can see them at any time.

For the price, you get a high quality dog treat camera that lets you interact with your dogs at any time of the day or night. Enjoy the fun of tossing treats to your fur babies. It will put a smile on your face.

### Can I use my own treats?

Yes. The Petzi dog camera treat dispenser can take 1 inch treats. It holds about 20 treats at a time but you can’t control how many are released. It may be more than one each time you dispense the treat. The treats need to be dry crunchy treats, the same as most other dog treat camera devices.

If you use the Milk Bone Mini’s dog treats which are 1 inch long but quite thin, you can fit about 100 in the dispenser.

### Do I have to place it on a wall?

The Petzi can be wall mounted or it can sit on a flat surface. Of course, it needs to be plugged in to an electrical socket and be within wifi range.

### Does it have a sound or motion sensor?

No. This dog camera treat dispenser does not provide barking notifications. You will need to log in to see your dogs.

There is a chime which alerts the dogs to the camera turning on and, of course, your voice will be heard when you call them. There is only one chime sound, you don’t have a choice of ringtones.

If you need a pet camera with a motion sensor you may need to use a wifi security camera or nanny cam. At this stage there don’t appear to be any dog treat cameras on the market with this functionality. This may change in the future.

### Can two people log in to the Petzi?

Yes, as long as you give the other person your password you can each log in to see your dog and release the treats. There is no limit on how many people can each use their smart phone at different times to access the Petzi, so long as they have the password.

However, it doesn’t allow you to log in at the same time. If one person is on it live, they will be disconnected so the next person can access the Petzi dog camera treat dispenser and release treats.
